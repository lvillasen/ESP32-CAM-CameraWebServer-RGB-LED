## Takes photos and controls an RGB LED with the ESP32-CAM on Arduino IDE

## Taken from the ESP examples and expanded to include an RGB LED

### This sketch is a extension of the 'official' ESP32 Camera example sketch from Espressif:

### https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/ESP32/examples/Camera/CameraWebServer

### expanded with

* control of an RGB LED


### Tested with AI-THINKER ESP32-CAM and ESP32-CAM-MB modules on Arduino IDE

### The ESP32-CAM is connected to the ESP32-CAM-MB module and the RGB LED as shown in the picture conection-ESP32-CAM-MB-RGB-LED.jpeg included 

### The sample jupyter notebook included illustrates how to take photos and control the RGB LED with Python
